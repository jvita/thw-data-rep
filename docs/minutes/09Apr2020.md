# 2020/04/09: choosing a data set

Created: Apr 09, 2020 9:36 AM

# Summary

Four datasets were proposed in total: [atomic spectral data](https://github.com/jvita/thw-data-rep/blob/master/docs/proposals/spectra_visualization.md), [NASA's exoplanet archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html), [COVID-19 data](https://github.com/jvita/thw-data-rep/blob/master/docs/proposals/covid_19.md), and [atomic trajectories of hydrogen](https://github.com/jvita/thw-data-rep/blob/master/docs/proposals/hsolid-vis.pdf). There was also a useful link to a [data-agnostic sonification method](http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=19712).

While there was lots of useful discussion and brainstorming, in the end we concluded that we probably don't necessarily need to choose a dataset yet. Each sub-group can just use whatever set they want in order to get started, then we can make a final decision later once we're ready to create a presentable prototype.

For now, our main focus is to have each sub-group make at least one commit to the git repo by next Saturday (4/18). The tentative "goals" are as follows:

- Back-end

    Create a framework that can take in data in some format (CSV, HDF5, etc.) and create *any* kind of sonification using an algorithm of their choice

- Front-end

    Familiarize themselves with React and start working towards a basic app that can download data from a given source.

Although a next meeting date wasn't explicitly discussed, a tentative date will be set to **4/23 at 12:30 (central time)**. Slack channels have also been set up to mediate discussions within each sub-group; newcomers to the project should add themselves to `#gp-back-end` and/or `#gp-front-end` as desired.
