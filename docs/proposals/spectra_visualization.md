### Visualizing Spectral Data

* 3D printing:
  * Molecules: might prove to be more complicated than we want -- learning to use CAD software -- unless there are files openly available?
  * If we have 2D spectra we could 3D print surfaces we generate from [yt](https://yt-project.org/)
* [xSonify](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xsonify/)
  * Sonifies 2D datasets -- could play around with it for spectra

##### Bonus cool things
* [Visualizing a light curve from a variable star](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.02930.pdf)
  * Could write sheet music! 
  * [Audio file from above paper](https://my.pcloud.com/publink/show?code=XZDua17ZafxBcBqhi2HOQgi0kVlR0uh6TPky)
  * This group breaks magnitude (brightness) ranges into tones from the chromatic scale, then sets the note (quarter, half, whole) based on the time interval. Pretty cool!
   * **We could also do something like this with spectra, should be easily translatable -- time interval corresponds to wavelength/frequency interval.**

  * Examples using xSonify (above)
    * Light curve for a variable star
    * Solar wind
